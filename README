I. Start Arguments

------------------

I. The application accepts a few argument sequences which allow initiation of loading
and converting documents at application startup. The last argument controls whether
the GUI launches or not. The application can be used to convert documents in console
mode which allows further use of the applaction's output in shell scripts.

If no argument is given or the last argument is "-g" or "--gui" the application's GUI
is launched.
Examples:
htmlatex
htmlatex -g
htmlatex --gui

If this argument is given two startup operations can be initiated:

a) The GUI can be launched with a source document loaded. This requires the source
file path and source file type.
Examples:
htmlatex index.html javadoc -g
htmlatex index.html javadoc --gui

b) The GUI can be launched with a source document converted to a target document.
This requires the source file path, source file type, target file path and target
file type.
Example:
htmlatex index.html javadoc mytexoutput.tex tex -g
htmlatex index.html javadoc mytexoutput.tex tex -gui

If the "-g" or "--gui" argument isn't given the application expects four arguments
in console mode: source file path, source file type, target file path and target
file type.
Example:
htmlatex index.html javadoc mytexoutput.tex tex
