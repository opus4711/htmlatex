I. Start Arguments

------------------

I. The application accepts a few argument sequences which allow initiation of loading
and converting documents at application startup. The argument "-g" or "--gui" launches
the GUI. The application can also be used to convert documents in console
mode which allows further use of the applaction's output in shell scripts.

The argument "-h" or "--help" is used to diplay the examples of this document section.
Examples:
htmlatex
htmlatex -h
htmlatex --help

If the "g" or "--gui" argument is given two startup operations can be initiated:

a) The GUI can be launched with a source document loaded. This requires the source
file path and source file type.
Examples:
htmlatex index.html javadoc -g
htmlatex index.html javadoc --gui

b) The GUI can be launched with a source document converted to a target document.
This requires the source file path, source file type, target file path and target
file type.
Example:
htmlatex index.html javadoc mytexoutput.tex tex -g
htmlatex index.html javadoc mytexoutput.tex tex -gui

If the "-g" or "--gui" argument isn't given the application expects four arguments
in console mode: source file path, source file type, target file path and target
file type.
Example:
htmlatex index.html javadoc mytexoutput.tex tex
